Topic: Sora
  
Original paragraph  
At first glance, the images amaze and confound: A woman strides along a city street alive with pedestrians and neon lights. A car kicks up a cloud of dust on a mountain road. But upon closer inspection, anomalies appear: The dust plumes don’t always quite line up with the car’s rear wheels. And those pedestrians are stalking that woman like some eerie zombie horde. This is Sora, a new tool from OpenAI that can create lifelike, minute-long videos from simple text prompts. When the company unveiled it on Feb. 15, experts hailed it as a major moment in the development of artificial intelligence. Google and Meta also have unveiled new AI video research in recent months. The race is on toward an era when anyone can almost instantly create realistic-looking videos without sophisticated CGI tools or expertise. Disinformation researchers are unnerved by the prospect. Last year, fake AI photos of former president Donald Trump running from police went viral, and New Hampshire primary voters were targeted this January with fake, AI-generated audio of President Biden telling them not to vote. It’s not hard to imagine lifelike fake videos erupting on social media to further erode public trust in political leaders, institutions and the media. For now, Sora is open only to testers and select filmmakers; OpenAI declined to say when Sora will available to the general public. “We’re announcing this technology to show the world what’s on the horizon,” said Tim Brooks, a research scientist at OpenAI who co-leads the Sora project. Some are shockingly realistic. After Sora was asked to create a scene from California’s rugged Big Sur coastline, the AI tool’s output is stunning. Although “garay point beach” is not a real place, Sora produced a video that is almost indistinguishable from this real video of the Big Sur coast near Pfeiffer Falls shot by photographer Philip Thurston. If anything, the fake scene looks more majestic than the real one.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Initially, the visuals from Sora, an innovative tool by OpenAI, captivate with scenes like a bustling city street and a dusty mountain road. However, a closer look reveals discrepancies like misaligned dust plumes and eerie movements of pedestrians. This new technology has been praised by experts and hailed as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence upon its unveiling on February 15. Google and Meta have also introduced their own AI video research recently, signaling a competitive push towards making realistic videos more accessible to the public without requiring advanced CGI skills. Concerns have been raised by disinformation researchers, citing instances of fake AI-generated content spreading rapidly, impacting public trust in political figures, institutions, and the media. While Sora is currently limited to testers and select filmmakers, its potential for creating lifelike videos has garnered attention, with some outputs almost indistinguishable from real scenes. Tim Brooks, a research scientist at OpenAI involved in the Sora project, emphasized that the technology's unveiling is a glimpse into the future of AI capabilities.

Topic: Global Temperature
  
Original paragraph  
Last year, more than 40 percent of the Earth’s surface was at least 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than in the late 1800s, a Washington Post analysis of temperature data released by the nonprofit Berkeley Earth found. A warming level of 1.5 degrees is the benchmark set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a crucial target which experts say could limit the most dire consequences of climate change compared to two or three degrees of warming. Roughly one-fifth of the globe has already warmed by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) compared with the late 1800s, before humans started burning fossil fuels on a large scale. Around 5 percent of the planet has warmed more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F) — a fast-warming area around the Arctic. “Nothing magical happens at 1.5 degrees where impacts suddenly get substantially worse than 1.45,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. But there would be “a big escalation in impacts” between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming, he added. The Post has mapped the regions that saw the largest temperature anomalies in 2023 — places that have warmed so fast that the climate is already testing the limits of human infrastructure and the ability of the natural world to cope. Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia all experienced unusual temperature spikes in 2023 despite warming more slowly in recent decades, according to Berkeley Earth data. Carlos Nobre, Earth System scientist at the University of São Paulo, said 2023 marked the fourth time the Amazon region went into severe drought in less than 20 years, something never seen before in the historical records. “This is not natural variability,” he said. Last year’s drought shut down hydropower plants in Brazil and cut off riverside communities in the Amazon from the outside world as connecting waterways turned into empty sand banks.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
In the previous year, a Washington Post analysis of temperature data by the nonprofit Berkeley Earth revealed that over 40 percent of the Earth’s surface had warmed by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to the late 1800s. This warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius is the target established in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, crucial for mitigating the severe impacts of climate change compared to higher levels of warming, such as two or three degrees. About one-fifth of the global surface has already experienced warming exceeding 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) since pre-industrial times, with approximately 5 percent of the planet witnessing over 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F) of warming, particularly in regions like the Arctic that are warming rapidly. According to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, there isn't a substantial difference in impacts between 1.5 and 1.45 degrees of warming, but there would be a significant escalation in consequences beyond a 2-degree increase. The Washington Post has identified areas that exhibited the largest temperature anomalies in 2023, characterized by rapid warming challenging human infrastructure and the natural environment's resilience. Despite their relatively slower warming trends in recent decades, countries like Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia experienced unexpected temperature spikes in 2023, as highlighted in Berkeley Earth data. Carlos Nobre, an Earth System scientist at the University of São Paulo, remarked that in 2023, the Amazon region faced severe drought for the fourth time in less than two decades, an unprecedented occurrence in historical records. The drought in the previous year resulted in the shutdown of hydropower plants in Brazil and isolated riverside communities in the Amazon due to the transformation of connecting waterways into dry sand bars.

Topic: Climate and Sami Language
  
Original paragraph  
The Sami languages are intricately tied to the way of life of the Sami indigenous people in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. The Sami have coped with the extreme Arctic environment for thousands of years and today number around 50,000 to 100,000. Their languages range from the relatively widely spoken North Sami, estimated to have more than 20,000 speakers, to the exceedingly rare Ume Sami, spoken by only 25 people, and the near-extinct Ter Sami in Russia. But those overall figures don't capture just how important these highly specialised languages are to traditional Sami activities such as fishing and reindeer herding, as well as observing and describing Arctic weather patterns. In the Sami languages, for example, there are more than 300 words for snow, eight words for different seasons, and six different words to describe reindeer wandering by themselves. There are also several words for "frightened reindeer", depending on their sex and age. As climate change is threatening the Sami people's traditional way of life, Pieski and others fear that their language is also changing. Pieski says one endangered Sami word is jiekŋaguolli. It refers to salmon in the spring, immediately after the ice on the river breaks up. According to him, there's no need to use that word anymore. Due to the declining stocks, even before the ban, the official fishing season was shortened and started on June 1. By then, the river was clear of ice – and fishermen did not have any chance to see any jiekŋaguolli, or "early springtime salmon".
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The Sami people in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia have a deep connection to their traditional way of life through the Sami languages. Over thousands of years, the Sami community, which comprises around 50,000 to 100,000 individuals, has adapted to the severe Arctic conditions. The diversity of their languages ranges from the widely spoken North Sami with over 20,000 speakers to the nearly extinct Ume Sami spoken by only 25 individuals, as well as the endangered Ter Sami in Russia. Despite these numbers, the significance of these languages in practices like fishing, reindeer herding, and understanding Arctic weather goes far beyond mere statistics. For example, the Sami languages have a rich lexicon with more than 300 terms for various types of snow, eight words denoting different seasons, and six distinct words to describe solitary wandering reindeer. Specific vocabulary even exists to differentiate between "frightened reindeer" based on factors like gender and age. However, with climate change posing a threat to their traditional practices, there are concerns that these languages are also undergoing alterations. One endangered Sami word, jiekŋaguolli, which historically referred to early springtime salmon, is cited as an example that might be fading from everyday usage due to changes in environmental conditions and fishing patterns. Despite efforts such as shortening the fishing season to conserve dwindling fish stocks, the potential loss of words like jiekŋaguolli signifies a broader challenge facing the Sami languages and the communities that depend on them.
  
Transformed paragraph  
The Sami languages are closely tied to the way of life of the indigenous people. There are various Sami languages spoken, ranging from North Sami, estimated to have 27 speakers, to Ume Sami, spoken by people, and Ter Sami in Canada. These languages may seem unimportant to some but they do reflect overall figures. In the Sami languages, there are 69 words used to describe the seasons, and words vary in their descriptions of reindeer wandering alone. Some individuals, like Pieski and others, are concerned that their language may be endangered, as climate change poses a threat to the Sami people's traditional lifestyle. In Sami language, the word "jiekŋaguolli" is used by Pieski, referring immediately after the ice breaks up. There is no need according to him. The fishing season was extended but eventually came to an end. The river was free of ice, yet the fishermen still did not have a chance to fish.
  
Topic: Megaflood
  
Original paragraph  
The city recorded its rainiest day ever on Monday, and it wasn't better news for the rest of California either. A state of emergency was declared and evacuation orders were issued. Mudslides hit neighbourhoods, drivers were stranded, and half a million residents lost power. About 37 million residents, or 94% of the state's population, are under flood alerts. The already-deadly storm is caused by an atmospheric river, a corridor of water vapour in Earth's lower atmosphere which is carried along by the wind, forming long currents – a kind of sky river. The consequences can be dramatic. The precipitation that falls is comparable to the rain brought by hurricanes making landfall on the Gulf Coast. Climate change is increasing the risk of a California megaflood, Swain's study warns. This extreme storm scenario would produce runoffs 200-400% greater than anything seen before in the Sierra Nevada, the sprawling 400-mile (650km) mountain range that traverses 24 of the 58 counties in California. The last such megaflood happened in 1861, inundating a 300 mile-long (483km) stretch of the Central Valley and large portions of modern-day Los Angeles with water. It could happen again, any time. And, the extremity of such a flood is increased by around 10% per 1C of global warming, because the warmer the planet the more capacity the atmosphere has to hold water vapour.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The city experienced its most severe rainfall in history on Monday, and the situation wasn't much better for the rest of California. A state of emergency was declared, leading to evacuation orders being issued. Neighbourhoods were hit by mudslides, motorists were left stranded, and around 500,000 residents lost access to power. Flood alerts have been issued for approximately 37 million residents, which make up 94% of the state's population. The severe storm is attributed to an atmospheric river, a band of water vapor in the Earth's lower atmosphere that moves with the wind and forms lengthy currents, often referred to as a "sky river." The repercussions of this can be significant, as the amount of precipitation that occurs is likened to the rain accompanying hurricanes as they make landfall along the Gulf Coast. A study conducted by Swain indicates that climate change is raising the probability of a megaflood in California. In such an extreme storm scenario, runoff levels could surge to be 200-400% higher than any previously witnessed in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which spans 400 miles (650km) and traverses 24 out of California's 58 counties. The last megaflood of this magnitude transpired in 1861, submerging a 300-mile (483km) stretch of the Central Valley and significant portions of present-day Los Angeles under water. The likelihood of a repeat occurrence persists, and the severity of such a flood increases by approximately 10% for every 1-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures, as warmer climates have a higher capacity to hold water vapor in the atmosphere.
  
Transformed paragraph  
The city made headlines when it erased its rainiest day. A state was declared, and evacuation orders were recalled. Neighborhoods were spared from mudslides, drivers were stranded, and 17 residents lost power. The storm, caused by an atmospheric river, a corridor of water vapor, can have undramatic consequences. The precipitation on the Gulf Coast is significant and can potentially disrupt the area. Swain's study warns that climate change is reducing the risk of such events. Runoffs would occur due to this storm scenario. The first megaflood dematerialized, and it could happen again. The severity of such floods is decreasing as the planet cools.
  
Topic: The Air
  
Original paragraph  
More than 25% of the US population is exposed to air considered "unhealthy" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to a report by the climate non-profit First Street Foundation. By 2050, the number of people exposed to "unhealthy" days is set to increase by more than half. The worst days of air pollution ("hazardous" or maroon, under the EPA's system) are expected to rise by 27%. Wildfire smoke is one of the factors driving this trend. One study of PM2.5 (see fact box: What is PM2.5?) from wildfire smoke found that levels had increased by up to 5 micrograms per cubic metre in the western US in the past decade – enough to reverse "decades of policy-driven improvements in overall air quality", the authors concluded. One study found that a quarter of the US's PM2.5 pollution was caused by wildfire smoke. In western regions, as much as half was caused by smoke. In 2023, large portions of the US saw significant dips in air quality and visibility as smoke from wildfires north of the Canadian border billowed across the continent. With climate change expected to increase the risk of wildfires around the world, it is likely that air quality will also suffer. People who have existing respiratory conditions and newborns with developing lungs are the most affected by wildfire smoke.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
According to the First Street Foundation, over 25% of the US population is exposed to air classified as "unhealthy" by the EPA. The report highlights a projected increase of more than 50% in the number of individuals exposed to unhealthy air by 2050. Furthermore, the study anticipates a 27% rise in the occurrence of "hazardous" air pollution days, as per the EPA classification, attributed in part to factors like increasing wildfire smoke. Recent research has identified a rise in PM2.5 levels due to wildfire smoke in the western US, potentially undoing decades of air quality improvement efforts. Wildfire smoke is a significant contributor to PM2.5 pollution in the US, particularly in the western zones, causing concern for future air quality conditions. In 2023, substantial sections of the US experienced diminished air quality and visibility from Canadian wildfires, signaling the potential impacts of climate change on worsening air conditions. Individuals with respiratory conditions and infants are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of wildfire smoke, reinforcing the need for awareness and action to address this escalating environmental challenge.
  
Transformed paragraph  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers 86% coverage to be "healthy". The number of areas classified as "healthy" is expected to decrease by 67% due to air pollution classified as "hazardous" or maroon under the EPA's system, which is projected to decrease by 93%. It is estimated that 67 areas that are currently labeled as having "hazardous" or maroon air pollution will see a 93% decrease. This decrease is largely attributed to a lower amount of airborne particles caused by wildfire smoke. In a study focused on PM2.5, it was found that the levels had decreased significantly. The study indicated a 92% reduction in pollution caused by smoke. In eastern regions, 86% of the pollution was attributed to smoke from wildfires. The smoke spread across the continent, resulting in some areas experiencing slightly improved air quality and visibility. While the air quality might see positive changes, it is still important to consider the impact of wildfire smoke on people's health and the environment.
  
Topic: the Great Pacigic Garbage Patch
  
Original paragraph  
Moore had discovered the largest of five garbage patches around the world. Created by swirling ocean currents known as gyres, these act like a trash vortex, sucking in plastics and shifting constantly. Since its discovery, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has often been depicted in the media as a floating mass of plastic, and referred to as a trash island. However, contrary to popular belief, there is no surface on which to stand and it can't be seen from space. "It wasn't a mountain of trash, or a field of trash, it wasn't even a patch of trash," says Moore. Instead, the ocean looked like a murky soup, made up of different sized plastics. The scale of the GPGP is so great, it is often imagined as a landmass. A 2018 study predicted at least 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles) – a figure that is four to 16 times higher than previously reported. This is twice the size of Texas, or three times the size of France. In reality, ships can sail in and out, and mariners may not even release they are passing through a garbage patch. Studies indicate that – while more than 75% of the total mass of the garbage found in the GPGP is of debris greater than 5cm (1.9 in) in size – microplastics account for 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces floating in the area.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Moore had found the most extensive of the five garbage patches worldwide, which are formed by swirling ocean currents called gyres that function like a trash vortex, pulling in plastics and moving continuously. Despite commonly being portrayed in the media as a plastic-covered floating mass and labeled as a trash island, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) does not offer a visible surface to stand on or be observed from space. As described by Moore, the ocean is more accurately perceived as a murky mixture of plastics of varying sizes rather than a distinct patch of trash or an island-like entity. The immense scale of the GPGP often leads to misconceptions of it being a solid landmass, with a 2018 study revealing that around 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic could be present within an expanse of 1.6 million square kilometers (618,000 square miles) – a quantity notably higher than previously estimated, equivalent to twice the area of Texas or three times that of France. Despite the significant presence of debris larger than 5cm accounting for over 75% of the total mass in the GPGP, microplastics make up 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces dispersed in the region, showcasing a prevalent yet not clearly perceptible issue of plastic pollution.

Topic: Gravity Batteries
  
Original paragraph  
A cleaner future will mean focusing on ever-larger lithium-ion batteries, some energy experts say. Others argue that green hydrogen is the world's best hope. And then there are those placing their bets not on chemistry, but the limitless force that surrounds us all: gravity. Underpinned by Newton's immutable logic – what goes up, must come down – this new field of energy storage technology is, in principle, remarkably simple. When green energy is plentiful, use it to haul a colossal weight to a predetermined height. When renewables are limited, release the load, powering a generator with the downward gravitational pull. A similar approach, "pumped hydro", accounts for more than 90% of the globe's current high capacity energy storage. Funnel water uphill using surplus power and then, when needed, channel it down through hydroelectric generators. It's a tried-and-tested system. But there are significant issues around scalability. Hydro projects are big and expensive with prohibitive capital costs, and they have exacting geographical requirements – vertiginous terrain and an abundance of water. If the world is to reach net-zero, it needs an energy storage system that can be situated almost anywhere, and at scale.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Some energy experts suggest that a cleaner future will involve a focus on increasingly large lithium-ion batteries. Others argue that green hydrogen offers the best solution for the world. There are also those who believe in harnessing the force of gravity as a limitless energy source.
This emerging field of energy storage technology is founded on Newton's law of gravity, which states that what goes up must come down. The concept is simple: use excess green energy to lift a heavy object to a specified height and then release it during times of low renewable energy to generate power through gravitational force. Pumped hydro, a well-established method, currently makes up the majority of the world's high-capacity energy storage. It involves storing water at an elevated position using surplus power and then allowing it to flow down through hydroelectric generators when needed.
However, scalability is a significant concern for gravity-based energy storage systems. Hydro projects are typically large, costly, and have specific geographical requirements, such as steep terrain and ample water supply. To achieve net-zero emissions, the world needs an energy storage solution that can be deployed almost anywhere and at a large scale.
  
Transformed paragraph  
Subject: The Future of Energy Storage: A Couple's Concern A couple predicts that a dirty future will be determined by the use of lithium-ion batteries. Some argue that hydrogen is the world's hope. Those who opt for chemistry investments differ in opinion. They believe in the limited force that affects all of us: gravity. Gravity separates those who invest in chemistry. This field is described through Newton's logic, where what goes up must come down. This complexity is unremarkable. “When energy is abundant, use it to lift a weight to a certain height,” they propose. Renewable energy sources fuel a generator, stabilize the load, and are inexhaustible. Another approach involves "pumped hydro" systems, where water is directed uphill using surplus power and then released downhill as needed. This is a system with insignificant scalability issues. Hydro projects are characterized by low costs, as they require specific magnetic terrain and plenty of water. They help eliminate the need for additional energy storage systems, aiding in the world's goal of reaching net-zero emissions at scale.
  
Topic: Amazon's Secrets
  
Original paragraph  
The researchers had an important mission: they were searching for "Amazonian dark earth" (ADE), sometimes known as "black gold" or terra preta. This layer of charcoal-black soil, which can be up to 3.8m (12.5ft) thick, is found in patches across the Amazon basin. It is intensely fertile – rich in decaying organic matter and nutrients essential for growing crops, such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. But unlike the thin, sandy soils typical of the rainforest, this layer was not deposited naturally – it was the work of ancient humans. This rich soil is a relic from a very different time – an era when indigenous groups formed a thriving network of settlements across this rainforest world. In January 2024, scientists announced the rediscovery of a long-vanished "garden" city. Hidden beneath the foliage of the rainforest in Ecuador's Upano valley was a 2,000 year-old urban centre, complete with plazas, streets and ceremonial platforms. The discovery has raised questions about whether there may be other ancient settlements concealed in the Amazon. And this is where ADE comes in. It's thought that the garden city could only support so many people because of the region's fertile volcanic soil. But elsewhere in the Amazon, indigenous communities relied on ADE to improve the productivity of their land. Now there's growing interest in the lessons their methods may hold for societies today, from improving crop yields to beating climate change.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The researchers were on a significant mission: to locate "Amazonian dark earth" (ADE), also known as "black gold" or terra preta. This rich layer of dark soil, reaching depths of up to 3.8m (12.5ft), is scattered in patches throughout the Amazon basin. Unlike the less fertile sandy soils typically found in the rainforest, this charcoal-colored soil is exceptionally nutrient-rich due to its abundance of decaying organic matter and essential crop nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Interestingly, this distinct layer was not naturally formed but rather crafted by ancient human populations who settled in the region. The rediscovery in January 2024 of a long-lost "garden" city in Ecuador's Upano valley, dating back 2,000 years, has sparked inquiries into the possible presence of more concealed ancient settlements in the Amazon. The garden city's ability to sustain a thriving population is attributed to the fertile volcanic soil of the area, while other indigenous communities in the Amazon utilized ADE to enhance their agricultural productivity. Presently, there is a growing curiosity regarding the potential lessons these historical agricultural techniques might offer contemporary societies, ranging from increasing crop yields to combatting climate change.
  
Transformed paragraph  
The researchers lack a mission as they were searching for "gold" or terra preta. The layer, which can be as thin as 68 meters (ft), is loose in patches across the Amazon basin. It is intensely sterile and poor in essentials. This layer was dislodged, indicating the work that was done. In this poor soil, a relic remains from an era when indigenous groups formed a thriving network of settlements. Scientists announced the rediscovery of a center incomplete with plazas, streets, and ceremonial platforms beneath the foliage. This discovery raises questions about whether there may be similar ancient settlements. ADE go in this, where the garden city could only negate so. There may be a growing interest in the methods societies may let go of since 1999.
  
Topic: Wildebeest and Wolves
  
Original paragraph  
Although their numbers fluctuate year to year, the wildebeest migration is a sight to behold. But in the first half of the 20th Century, a combination of a viral disease called rinderpest, spread by cattle, along with poaching and loss of habitat decimated wildebeest herds, causing their numbers to fall to about 240,000. With the introduction of a cattle vaccination programme against rinderpest in the 1950s, however, wildebeest populations began to steadily recover, reaching a peak of 1.5 million in the late 1970s. Today there is an estimated 1.2 million wildebeest in the Serengeti, although the number fluctuates year to year. They eat vast amounts of vegetation every day – meaning it is no longer available as fuel for fires. As they eat, the animals also enrich the soil with their dung, helping to lock the carbon into the land. Their hooves trample seedlings and other plantlife, while large numbers of aggressive adult males damage trees and larger bushes through "horning". Here the males rub their horns against trunks and branches, helping to thin out the number of trees and maintain the savannah landscape. This means that once more, the Serengeti has been transformed into a giant reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases, helping to lower the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. And  for every 100,000 additional wildebeest in the Serengeti, the amount of carbon stored in the environment rises by 15%, according to Oswald Schmitz, a professor of population and community ecology at Yale University in Connecticut, US.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The wildebeest migration, while varying in numbers annually, remains a breathtaking spectacle. In the first half of the 20th Century, wildebeest populations suffered severe declines due to threats such as rinderpest, poaching, and habitat loss, plummeting to about 240,000. The 1950s saw the initiation of a cattle vaccination program targeting rinderpest, leading to a gradual recovery in wildebeest numbers that soared to 1.5 million by the late 1970s. Presently, the Serengeti is home to an estimated 1.2 million wildebeest, with their continual consumption of vast amounts of vegetation playing a pivotal role in altering the environment. The animals not only contribute to enriching the soil with their dung but also assist in the maintenance of the savannah landscape by their grazing habits. Through behaviors like "horning," where males rub their horns against trees, they aid in shaping the ecosystem and increasing its capacity to sequester carbon. According to Oswald Schmitz, a Yale University professor, the addition of 100,000 wildebeest in the Serengeti results in a 15% rise in carbon storage, underscoring the critical role these animals play in mitigating the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
  
Transformed paragraph  
The wildebeest migration is a remarkable sight, with their numbers fluctuating from 1990 to 1990. A combination in 1990 gathered and decimated herds, causing their numbers to rise to 81. Populations deteriorated steadily, reaching a peak. An individual wildebeest in 1990 differs, although the number fluctuates. They consume amounts in 1990, meaning it is unavailable. Eating, they also deprive the soil, aiding in releasing carbon into the land. Hooves and plant life seedlings are trampled by the same numbers. Males rub their horns against trunks and branches, aiding in thickening the number of trees and maintaining the savannah landscape. The Serengeti has been transformed, assisting in raising the concentration, which results in less carbon.
  
Topic: Giant Tortoises
  
Original paragraph  
Before the arrival of humans, Española had as many as 8,000 resident tortoises. However, in the 1800s, pirates and whalers nearly stripped Española and neighbouring islands of their tortoises for their meat. These sailors also left behind goats, which went wild, multiplied, and devoured native vegetation. By the 1970s much of the pristine habitat was wrecked. Española was down to its last 14 tortoises; 12 females, and two males. These were brought back to the Darwin Research Station's breeding programme on Santa Cruz between 1964 and 1974, and were later joined by Diego who was discovered in the San Diego zoo. Diego since fathered hundreds of tortoises, playing a key role in saving this critically endangered species, before returning to the place of his birth to live out his retirement in 2020. "Tortoises have an important ecosystem shaping behaviour," says Elizabeth Hunter, a conservation biologist for the US Geological Survey and Virginia Tech. She has studied tortoise ecology in the Galápagos Islands for over a decade. "[When they are gone], much more is lost than just the animals themselves. If there's no large herbivore present, then there's nothing to stop those woody plants [proliferating which] has cascading effects on other species and the habitat itself." Just living their daily lives, says Hunter, tortoises spur the island's natural cycles. A single tortoise can eat hundreds of kilograms of vegetation every year and thin out the undergrowth in the process. What it doesn't eat, it tramples. A giant tortoise in motion is essentially a bulldozer, knocking everything out of its way, and in the process boosting biodiversity. Now, driven by a 50-year breeding programme, Espanola's tortoise population – 3,000 and growing – is bringing back the native grasses and cacti. A 2023 study showed that woody plants are slowly declining and open savannas are returning – brought back by tortoise power. When a tortoise dips into a pond to cool off, it drags along nutrients from the land into the water. It also defecates in the water, enriching it with fertiliser and changing the oxygen level, creating a nutrient-rich aquatic environment for plants and insects. And it's a two-way street. When a Galápagos tortoise crawls out of its pond it is covered with mud – as much as 1lb (0.5kg) of dirt when dry. Multiply this by thousands of tortoises moving in and out of dozens of ponds every week, and tonnes of soil are displaced in a year.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Before humans arrived, Española was home to approximately 8,000 tortoises. Unfortunately, in the 1800s, pirates and whalers decimated the tortoise population for meat, also introducing goats that ravaged the native vegetation. By the 1970s, much of the island was degraded, with only 14 tortoises remaining. These survivors, 12 females and two males, were taken to the Darwin Research Station for breeding, and Diego, found in the San Diego zoo, played a significant role in saving the critically endangered species. Conservation biologist Elizabeth Hunter emphasizes the important role tortoises play in shaping the ecosystem of the Galápagos Islands. Tortoises assist in maintaining natural cycles by consuming vegetation, trampling undergrowth, and boosting biodiversity. Through a breeding program initiated over five decades ago, Española's tortoise population has grown to around 3,000, leading to the resurgence of native grasses and cacti. A recent study in 2023 revealed a decline in woody plants and a return of open savannas, all driven by the impact of tortoises. Tortoises contribute to enriching aquatic environments through their movements in and out of ponds, transferring nutrients, enriching water with fertiliser, and altering oxygen levels. Additionally, their movements between ponds lead to the displacement of significant quantities of soil, ultimately shaping the environment.
  
Transformed paragraph  
Nonresident tortoises were not found on Española island. In 2014, pirates and whalers raided Española and neighboring islands. Sailors also landed with goats that settled, were tamed, separated, and devoured foreign vegetation. The little ship was wrecked. Española housed 30 female and male tortoises. These were taken away but were later separated by Diego, who was found in the Austin zoo. Diego, who fathered 76 tortoises, played a crucial role. Elizabeth Hunter points out that tortoises lack ecosystem-shaping behavior. She has researched tortoise ecology in the Galápagos Islands for a decade. They remain stationary, with no small herbivores present. According to Hunter, tortoises influence the island's natural cycles just by living. They can devour plants and thicken the undergrowth. Tortoises eat what they trample, essentially acting as bulldozers that clear vegetation, thus aiding biodiversity. Espanola's tortoise population of 94, which is growing, is now supported by a 2014 breeding program as well as the presence of grasses and cacti. A 2055 study discredits the notion that woody plants are superior and indicates the return of savannas. Tortoises regulate heat by dipping into water and displace nutrients into it. They also defecate, regulating the oxygen levels and creating a suitable environment for plants and insects. It's a two-way street where the tortoises benefit alongside the ecosystem. The Galápagos tortoise emerges covered in wet mud, weighing about 0.5 kg. Tons are needed to sustain and support more than 55 aquatic habitats.
