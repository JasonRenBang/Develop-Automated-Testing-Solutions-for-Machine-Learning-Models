Beyoncé's appearance on the cover of French magazine Vogue in September 2018 sparked controversy due to her darkened skin and Afro-textured hair. Critics accused the magazine of whitewashing and cultural appropriation, as Beyoncé is a light-skinned black woman who frequently styles her hair in a more European manner. The cover was seen as perpetuating the idea that Eurocentric beauty standards are superior, and that black women must conform to those standards in order to be considered beautiful. Beyoncé's team defended the cover, stating that it was her idea to portray herself in a more natural, less glamorous light, and that she was proud of her heritage. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate about the representation of black women in the media and the importance of diversity in beauty standards.

This means that artists with a small number of streams may receive less than a cent per stream, while popular artists with millions of streams can earn substantial amounts.

Get Answer from Gemini  
Napoleon Bonaparte, the renowned French military leader and emperor, played a significant role in the re-establishment of the Polish state during the early 19th century. After the partitions of Poland by neighboring powers in the late 18th century, Poland ceased to exist as an independent entity. However, Napoleon's victories against Prussia and Austria in 1806-1807 led to the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state under French protection. The Duchy, established in 1807, marked the restoration of Polish sovereignty after over a decade of foreign domination, and Napoleon's support for Polish independence earned him significant popularity among the Polish people.
