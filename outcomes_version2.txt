Topic: Sora
  
Original paragraph  
At first glance, the images amaze and confound: A woman strides along a city street alive with pedestrians and neon lights. A car kicks up a cloud of dust on a mountain road. But upon closer inspection, anomalies appear: The dust plumes don't always quite line up with the car's rear wheels. And those pedestrians are stalking that woman like some eerie zombie horde. This is Sora, a new tool from OpenAI that can create lifelike, minute-long videos from simple text prompts. When the company unveiled it on Feb. 15, experts hailed it as a major moment in the development of artificial intelligence. Google and Meta also have unveiled new AI video research in recent months. The race is on toward an era when anyone can almost instantly create realistic-looking videos without sophisticated CGI tools or expertise. Disinformation researchers are unnerved by the prospect. Last year, fake AI photos of former president Donald Trump running from police went viral, and New Hampshire primary voters were targeted this January with fake, AI-generated audio of President Biden telling them not to vote. It’s not hard to imagine lifelike fake videos erupting on social media to further erode public trust in political leaders, institutions and the media. For now, Sora is open only to testers and select filmmakers; OpenAI declined to say when Sora will available to the general public. “We're announcing this technology to show the world what's on the horizon,” said Tim Brooks, a research scientist at OpenAI who co-leads the Sora project. Some are shockingly realistic. After Sora was asked to create a scene from California’s rugged Big Sur coastline, the AI tool’s output is stunning. Although “garay point beach” is not a real place, Sora produced a video that is almost indistinguishable from this real video of the Big Sur coast near Pfeiffer Falls shot by photographer Philip Thurston. If anything, the fake scene looks more majestic than the real one.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Initially, the visuals are captivating and perplexing, showcasing a woman in a bustling city street and a car on a mountain road. However, upon closer examination, discrepancies emerge, such as the dust plumes not aligning perfectly with the car's rear wheels and the unsettling behavior of pedestrians toward the woman. OpenAI's latest creation, Sora, is a revolutionary tool that generates lifelike video clips based on simple text descriptions, receiving acclaim as a significant advancement in AI by experts when it was introduced on Feb. 15. Competitors like Google and Meta have also introduced innovative AI video capabilities recently, hinting at a future where creating realistic videos without complex CGI tools becomes accessible to everyone. The potential implications of this technology are concerning for disinformation researchers, given the history of fake AI content deceiving the public, like manipulated photos of Donald Trump and AI-generated audio of President Biden. While Sora is currently restricted to testers and select filmmakers, it remains undisclosed when it will be accessible to the general public. Tim Brooks, a lead of the Sora project at OpenAI, highlights that the unveiling of this technology is intended to offer a glimpse into the future possibilities. Sora has demonstrated astonishing realism, including crafting a visually breathtaking video inspired by a fictional location, "garay point beach," with the output rivaling or surpassing footage of the authentic Big Sur coast captured by photographer Philip Thurston.

Topic: Global Temperature
  
Original paragraph  
Last year, more than 40 percent of the Earth’s surface was at least 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than in the late 1800s, a Washington Post analysis of temperature data released by the nonprofit Berkeley Earth found. A warming level of 1.5 degrees is the benchmark set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a crucial target which experts say could limit the most dire consequences of climate change compared to two or three degrees of warming. Roughly one-fifth of the globe has already warmed by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) compared with the late 1800s, before humans started burning fossil fuels on a large scale. Around 5 percent of the planet has warmed more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F) — a fast-warming area around the Arctic. “Nothing magical happens at 1.5 degrees where impacts suddenly get substantially worse than 1.45,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. But there would be “a big escalation in impacts” between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming, he added. The Post has mapped the regions that saw the largest temperature anomalies in 2023 — places that have warmed so fast that the climate is already testing the limits of human infrastructure and the ability of the natural world to cope. Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia all experienced unusual temperature spikes in 2023 despite warming more slowly in recent decades, according to Berkeley Earth data. Carlos Nobre, Earth System scientist at the University of São Paulo, said 2023 marked the fourth time the Amazon region went into severe drought in less than 20 years, something never seen before in the historical records. “This is not natural variability,” he said. Last year’s drought shut down hydropower plants in Brazil and cut off riverside communities in the Amazon from the outside world as connecting waterways turned into empty sand banks.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
According to a Washington Post analysis of temperature data from the nonprofit Berkeley Earth, over 40 percent of the Earth's surface last year was warmer by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to the late 1800s. This warming level of 1.5 degrees is the target established in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to help mitigate the severe impacts of climate change. Approximately one-fifth of the planet has experienced an increase of over 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) since the late 1800s due to human activities like widespread fossil fuel combustion. Around 5 percent of the Earth has seen a rise of more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F), particularly noticeable in the rapidly warming Arctic region. Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth noted that while there may not be a distinct tipping point at 1.5 degrees, the impacts of climate change escalate significantly between this threshold and 2 degrees of warming. The Washington Post has identified regions with the largest temperature anomalies in 2023, pointing to places where climate change is already straining human infrastructure and natural ecosystems. In 2023, countries like Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia witnessed abnormal temperature spikes, with the Amazon region facing its fourth severe drought within two decades, as confirmed by Carlos Nobre, an Earth System scientist at the University of São Paulo. Nobre emphasized that the frequency and intensity of recent extreme climate events are unprecedented in historical records, such as last year's drought in Brazil that disrupted hydropower generation and isolated Amazon communities due to dried-up waterways.

According to the Times analysis of temperature data from the nonprofit Berkeley Earth, over 30 percent of the Earth's surface last year was warmer by at least 2 degrees Celsius compared to the late 1850s. This warming level of 2 degrees is the target established in the 2010 Paris climate agreement to help mitigate the severe impacts of climate change. Approximately two-fifth of the planet has experienced an increase of over 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) since the late 1850s due to human activities like widespread fossil fuel combustion. Around 10 percent of the Earth has seen a rise of more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F), particularly noticeable in the rapidly warming Arctic region. Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth noted that while there may not be a distinct tipping point at 1.5 degrees, the impacts of climate change escalate significantly between this threshold and 2 degrees of warming. The Washington Post has identified regions with the largest temperature anomalies in 2020, pointing to places where climate change is already straining human infrastructure and natural ecosystems. In 2023, countries like US, UK, and Canada witnessed abnormal temperature spikes, with the Amazon region facing its fourth severe drought within two decades, as confirmed by Carlos Nobre, an Earth System scientist at the University of São Paulo. Nobre emphasized that the frequency and intensity of recent extreme climate events are unprecedented in historical records, such as last year's drought in Brazil that disrupted hydropower generation and isolated Amazon communities due to dried-up waterways.

Topic: Climate and Sami Language
  
Original paragraph  
The Sami languages are intricately tied to the way of life of the Sami indigenous people in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. The Sami have coped with the extreme Arctic environment for thousands of years and today number around 50,000 to 100,000. Their languages range from the relatively widely spoken North Sami, estimated to have more than 20,000 speakers, to the exceedingly rare Ume Sami, spoken by only 25 people, and the near-extinct Ter Sami in Russia. But those overall figures don't capture just how important these highly specialised languages are to traditional Sami activities such as fishing and reindeer herding, as well as observing and describing Arctic weather patterns. In the Sami languages, for example, there are more than 300 words for snow, eight words for different seasons, and six different words to describe reindeer wandering by themselves. There are also several words for "frightened reindeer", depending on their sex and age. As climate change is threatening the Sami people's traditional way of life, Pieski and others fear that their language is also changing. Pieski says one endangered Sami word is jiekŋaguolli. It refers to salmon in the spring, immediately after the ice on the river breaks up. According to him, there's no need to use that word anymore. Due to the declining stocks, even before the ban, the official fishing season was shortened and started on June 1. By then, the river was clear of ice – and fishermen did not have any chance to see any jiekŋaguolli, or "early springtime salmon".
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The languages spoken by the Sami people are deeply intertwined with their traditional way of life in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Having adapted to the harsh Arctic conditions for centuries, the Sami population today is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 individuals. While some dialects like North Sami are more widely spoken, others such as Ume Sami, spoken by only 25 people, and Ter Sami in Russia, which is on the brink of extinction, highlight the diversity and uniqueness of these languages. These highly specialized languages play a crucial role in various aspects of traditional Sami activities like fishing, reindeer herding, and the observation and description of Arctic weather patterns. For instance, the Sami languages boast a rich vocabulary with over 300 words for snow, eight terms for distinct seasons, and six different words to describe solitary wandering reindeer. Moreover, there are nuanced expressions for "frightened reindeer," each varying depending on the gender and age of the animal. As climate change poses a threat to the Sami culture and way of life, individuals like Pieski are concerned about potential language changes. Pieski points out that a word like "jiekŋaguolli," referring to the spring salmon after the river ice melts, is at risk of disappearing given the altered fishing seasons and declining fish stocks. With the official fishing season starting later in June when ice is absent, the traditional early springtime salmon sightings, or jiekŋaguolli, have become rare, further underscoring the impact of environmental changes on both the Sami language and way of life.

Topic: Megaflood
  
Original paragraph  
The city recorded its rainiest day ever on Monday, and it wasn't better news for the rest of California either. A state of emergency was declared and evacuation orders were issued. Mudslides hit neighbourhoods, drivers were stranded, and half a million residents lost power. About 37 million residents, or 94% of the state's population, are under flood alerts. The already-deadly storm is caused by an atmospheric river, a corridor of water vapour in Earth's lower atmosphere which is carried along by the wind, forming long currents – a kind of sky river. The consequences can be dramatic. The precipitation that falls is comparable to the rain brought by hurricanes making landfall on the Gulf Coast. Climate change is increasing the risk of a California megaflood, Swain's study warns. This extreme storm scenario would produce runoffs 200-400% greater than anything seen before in the Sierra Nevada, the sprawling 400-mile (650km) mountain range that traverses 24 of the 58 counties in California. The last such megaflood happened in 1861, inundating a 300 mile-long (483km) stretch of the Central Valley and large portions of modern-day Los Angeles with water. It could happen again, any time. And, the extremity of such a flood is increased by around 10% per 1C of global warming, because the warmer the planet the more capacity the atmosphere has to hold water vapour.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The city experienced its wettest day in history on Monday, with the situation not faring any better for California as a whole. A state of emergency was declared with evacuation orders in place. Mudslides impacted neighborhoods, motorists were left stranded, and 500,000 residents were left without power. Nearly 37 million residents, equivalent to 94% of the state's population, are currently under flood alerts. The deadly storm, driven by an atmospheric river - a pathway of water vapor in the Earth's lower atmosphere - carried by the wind, creating long currents akin to a "sky river," has proven to have serious consequences. The rainfall associated with this storm rivals that of hurricanes making landfall on the Gulf Coast. A study by Swain cautioned that climate change is elevating the risk of a colossal flood in California, with projected runoffs ranging between 200-400% greater than previously observed in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which spans 400 miles (650km) and crosses through 24 of the state's 58 counties. The last large-scale flood occurred in 1861, submerging a 300-mile (483km) stretch of the Central Valley and significant parts of present-day Los Angeles. This calamity could potentially recur at any moment, with the intensity of such an event rising by approximately 10% for every 1-degree Celsius of global warming, as a warmer climate holds more water vapor in the atmosphere.

Topic: The Air
  
Original paragraph  
More than 25% of the US population is exposed to air considered "unhealthy" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to a report by the climate non-profit First Street Foundation. By 2050, the number of people exposed to "unhealthy" days is set to increase by more than half. The worst days of air pollution ("hazardous" or maroon, under the EPA's system) are expected to rise by 27%. Wildfire smoke is one of the factors driving this trend. One study of PM2.5 (see fact box: What is PM2.5?) from wildfire smoke found that levels had increased by up to 5 micrograms per cubic metre in the western US in the past decade – enough to reverse "decades of policy-driven improvements in overall air quality", the authors concluded. One study found that a quarter of the US's PM2.5 pollution was caused by wildfire smoke. In western regions, as much as half was caused by smoke. In 2023, large portions of the US saw significant dips in air quality and visibility as smoke from wildfires north of the Canadian border billowed across the continent. With climate change expected to increase the risk of wildfires around the world, it is likely that air quality will also suffer. People who have existing respiratory conditions and newborns with developing lungs are the most affected by wildfire smoke.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
According to a report by the climate non-profit First Street Foundation, more than a quarter of the US population is exposed to air categorized as "unhealthy" by the EPA. The same report suggests that by 2050, the number of individuals facing "unhealthy" air quality is projected to surge by over 50%. The forecast also indicates a potential 27% increase in days with the most severe pollution levels ("hazardous" or maroon classification by the EPA) due to factors such as wildfire smoke. Research concerning PM2.5 levels originating from wildfires indicates a concerning trend, with some regions in the western United States experiencing up to a 5-microgram per cubic meter spike over the past decade - a leap significant enough to undo considerable progress in air quality achieved through policy efforts. Additionally, one study highlights that as much as a quarter of the US's PM2.5 pollution could be attributed to wildfire smoke, a figure that may climb to half in certain western areas. Notably, in 2023, substantial parts of the United States encountered a decline in air quality and visibility as smoke from wildfires situated to the north spread across the continent. With the looming threat of heightened wildfire risks globally due to climate change, the impact on air quality is expected to be profound, especially affecting individuals with respiratory ailments and newborns, whose developing lungs are particularly vulnerable to the ramifications of wildfire smoke.

Topic: the Great Pacigic Garbage Patch
  
Original paragraph  
Moore had discovered the largest of five garbage patches around the world. Created by swirling ocean currents known as gyres, these act like a trash vortex, sucking in plastics and shifting constantly. Since its discovery, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has often been depicted in the media as a floating mass of plastic, and referred to as a trash island. However, contrary to popular belief, there is no surface on which to stand and it can't be seen from space. "It wasn't a mountain of trash, or a field of trash, it wasn't even a patch of trash," says Moore. Instead, the ocean looked like a murky soup, made up of different sized plastics. The scale of the GPGP is so great, it is often imagined as a landmass. A 2018 study predicted at least 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles) – a figure that is four to 16 times higher than previously reported. This is twice the size of Texas, or three times the size of France. In reality, ships can sail in and out, and mariners may not even release they are passing through a garbage patch. Studies indicate that – while more than 75% of the total mass of the garbage found in the GPGP is of debris greater than 5cm (1.9 in) in size – microplastics account for 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces floating in the area.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Moore made a groundbreaking discovery when he found the largest of five garbage patches worldwide, formed by ocean currents called gyres that create a trash vortex by pulling in plastics that continually shift. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has often been misrepresented in the media as a massive floating plastic mass or a trash island, but in reality, it lacks a visible surface and isn't observable from space. Rather than a distinct pile or field of trash, Moore describes the GPGP as resembling a murky soup comprised of plastics of varying sizes. Due to its enormous size, the GPGP is often conceptualized as a giant landmass, with a 2018 study projecting that around 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic are dispersed within an expansive area of 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles), a quantity significantly higher than previously estimated. This area is two times the size of Texas or three times the size of France, yet ships can navigate through it without realizing they are passing through a garbage patch. Research shows that, despite over 75% of the total debris mass in the GPGP consisting of pieces larger than 5cm (1.9 in), microplastics make up 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion fragments floating in the region.

Topic: Gravity Batteries
  
Original paragraph  
A cleaner future will mean focusing on ever-larger lithium-ion batteries, some energy experts say. Others argue that green hydrogen is the world's best hope. And then there are those placing their bets not on chemistry, but the limitless force that surrounds us all: gravity. Underpinned by Newton's immutable logic – what goes up, must come down – this new field of energy storage technology is, in principle, remarkably simple. When green energy is plentiful, use it to haul a colossal weight to a predetermined height. When renewables are limited, release the load, powering a generator with the downward gravitational pull. A similar approach, "pumped hydro", accounts for more than 90% of the globe's current high capacity energy storage. Funnel water uphill using surplus power and then, when needed, channel it down through hydroelectric generators. It's a tried-and-tested system. But there are significant issues around scalability. Hydro projects are big and expensive with prohibitive capital costs, and they have exacting geographical requirements – vertiginous terrain and an abundance of water. If the world is to reach net-zero, it needs an energy storage system that can be situated almost anywhere, and at scale.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Some experts advocate for a cleaner future through larger lithium-ion batteries, while others suggest green hydrogen as the most promising solution. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in energy storage technology based on gravity's force, supported by Newton's law of gravity. This innovative method involves raising a heavy weight using surplus green energy and then harnessing the gravitational pull when needed by releasing the load to generate power. The "pumped hydro" system, which uses surplus energy to move water uphill and generate electricity through hydroelectric power plants, currently dominates global high-capacity energy storage methods. However, despite its effectiveness, hydro projects face challenges in scalability due to their size, cost, and specific geographical requirements. To achieve net-zero emissions, there is a need for energy storage systems that are versatile, scalable, and suitable for various locations.

Topic: Amazon's Secrets
  
Original paragraph  
The researchers had an important mission: they were searching for "Amazonian dark earth" (ADE), sometimes known as "black gold" or terra preta. This layer of charcoal-black soil, which can be up to 3.8m (12.5ft) thick, is found in patches across the Amazon basin. It is intensely fertile – rich in decaying organic matter and nutrients essential for growing crops, such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. But unlike the thin, sandy soils typical of the rainforest, this layer was not deposited naturally – it was the work of ancient humans. This rich soil is a relic from a very different time – an era when indigenous groups formed a thriving network of settlements across this rainforest world. In January 2024, scientists announced the rediscovery of a long-vanished "garden" city. Hidden beneath the foliage of the rainforest in Ecuador's Upano valley was a 2,000 year-old urban centre, complete with plazas, streets and ceremonial platforms. The discovery has raised questions about whether there may be other ancient settlements concealed in the Amazon. And this is where ADE comes in. It's thought that the garden city could only support so many people because of the region's fertile volcanic soil. But elsewhere in the Amazon, indigenous communities relied on ADE to improve the productivity of their land. Now there's growing interest in the lessons their methods may hold for societies today, from improving crop yields to beating climate change.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The researchers had a crucial objective of finding "Amazonian dark earth" (ADE), also referred to as "black gold" or terra preta. This layer of charcoal-black soil, which may reach up to 3.8m (12.5ft) in thickness, is scattered throughout the Amazon basin. It is highly fertile, abundant in decaying organic matter and essential nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus for cultivating crops. Unlike the naturally deposited thin, sandy soils of the rainforest, this layer was created by ancient human activities. This fertile soil serves as a remnant of a bygone era when indigenous communities established a thriving network of settlements in the rainforest. In January 2024, researchers announced the rediscovery of a vanished "garden" city dating back 2,000 years in Ecuador's Upano valley, featuring plazas, streets, and ceremonial platforms. This discovery has sparked inquiries into the potential presence of other ancient settlements hidden in the Amazon, with ADE playing a crucial role. The belief is that the garden city could only thrive due to the fertile volcanic soil in the region, while other indigenous communities in the Amazon utilized ADE to enhance their land's productivity. There is now a growing interest in the potential benefits of adopting their agricultural methods, from enhancing crop yields to addressing climate change.
  
Manual transformation  
The researchers had a minor objective of finding "Amazonian light earth" (ALE), also referred to as "white sand" or terra clara. This layer of white sandy soil, which may only be a few centimeters thick, is rarely found across the Amazon basin. It is infertile, lacking in decaying organic matter and essential nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus necessary for cultivating crops. Unlike the artificially enriched deep, loamy soils of the rainforest, this layer was formed by natural geological processes. This infertile soil is seen as evidence of a time when indigenous communities struggled to maintain small, isolated settlements in the rainforest. In January 2020, researchers announced the rediscovery of a forgotten "desert" city dating back 200 years in Ecuador's Upano valley, featuring a few scattered huts and basic agricultural plots. This discovery has sparked inquiries into the potential presence of other ancient, struggling settlements hidden in the Amazon, with ALE being mistakenly credited. The belief is that the desert city could only survive due to the infertile volcanic soil in the region, while other indigenous communities in the Amazon mistakenly tried to use ALE to improve their land's productivity. There is now a growing interest in understanding the limitations of their agricultural methods, from reducing crop yields to exacerbating climate change.

Topic: Wildebeest and Wolves
  
Original paragraph  
Although their numbers fluctuate year to year, the wildebeest migration is a sight to behold. But in the first half of the 20th Century, a combination of a viral disease called rinderpest, spread by cattle, along with poaching and loss of habitat decimated wildebeest herds, causing their numbers to fall to about 240,000. With the introduction of a cattle vaccination programme against rinderpest in the 1950s, however, wildebeest populations began to steadily recover, reaching a peak of 1.5 million in the late 1970s. Today there is an estimated 1.2 million wildebeest in the Serengeti, although the number fluctuates year to year. They eat vast amounts of vegetation every day – meaning it is no longer available as fuel for fires. As they eat, the animals also enrich the soil with their dung, helping to lock the carbon into the land. Their hooves trample seedlings and other plantlife, while large numbers of aggressive adult males damage trees and larger bushes through "horning". Here the males rub their horns against trunks and branches, helping to thin out the number of trees and maintain the savannah landscape. This means that once more, the Serengeti has been transformed into a giant reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases, helping to lower the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. And  for every 100,000 additional wildebeest in the Serengeti, the amount of carbon stored in the environment rises by 15%, according to Oswald Schmitz, a professor of population and community ecology at Yale University in Connecticut, US.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The wildebeest migration, while experiencing fluctuating numbers annually, remains a remarkable spectacle. In the early 20th Century, wildebeest herds were severely impacted by a viral disease called rinderpest, transmitted by cattle, in addition to poaching and habitat loss, leading to a drastic decline in their population to around 240,000 individuals. The implementation of a cattle vaccination campaign against rinderpest in the 1950s marked a turning point, prompting a gradual recovery in wildebeest numbers, peaking at 1.5 million by the late 1970s. Currently, an estimated 1.2 million wildebeest roam the Serengeti, with their grazing habits playing a crucial role in altering the landscape and carbon cycle of the region. As they consume significant amounts of vegetation daily, they limit fuel available for fires and enrich the soil with their dung, aiding in carbon sequestration. Through their grazing and tree-damaging behaviors, particularly by the aggressive adult males rubbing their horns against vegetation, the wildebeest contribute to maintaining the savannah ecosystem and mitigating atmospheric CO2 levels. Oswald Schmitz, a professor specializing in population and community ecology at Yale University, suggests that for each additional 100,000 wildebeest present in the Serengeti, a 15% rise in carbon storage is observed, emphasizing their significant ecological impact.

Topic: Giant Tortoises
  
Original paragraph  
Before the arrival of humans, Española had as many as 8,000 resident tortoises. However, in the 1800s, pirates and whalers nearly stripped Española and neighbouring islands of their tortoises for their meat. These sailors also left behind goats, which went wild, multiplied, and devoured native vegetation. By the 1970s much of the pristine habitat was wrecked. Española was down to its last 14 tortoises; 12 females, and two males. These were brought back to the Darwin Research Station's breeding programme on Santa Cruz between 1964 and 1974, and were later joined by Diego who was discovered in the San Diego zoo. Diego since fathered hundreds of tortoises, playing a key role in saving this critically endangered species, before returning to the place of his birth to live out his retirement in 2020. "Tortoises have an important ecosystem shaping behaviour," says Elizabeth Hunter, a conservation biologist for the US Geological Survey and Virginia Tech. She has studied tortoise ecology in the Galápagos Islands for over a decade. "[When they are gone], much more is lost than just the animals themselves. If there's no large herbivore present, then there's nothing to stop those woody plants [proliferating which] has cascading effects on other species and the habitat itself." Just living their daily lives, says Hunter, tortoises spur the island's natural cycles. A single tortoise can eat hundreds of kilograms of vegetation every year and thin out the undergrowth in the process. What it doesn't eat, it tramples. A giant tortoise in motion is essentially a bulldozer, knocking everything out of its way, and in the process boosting biodiversity. Now, driven by a 50-year breeding programme, Espanola's tortoise population – 3,000 and growing – is bringing back the native grasses and cacti. A 2023 study showed that woody plants are slowly declining and open savannas are returning – brought back by tortoise power. When a tortoise dips into a pond to cool off, it drags along nutrients from the land into the water. It also defecates in the water, enriching it with fertiliser and changing the oxygen level, creating a nutrient-rich aquatic environment for plants and insects. And it's a two-way street. When a Galápagos tortoise crawls out of its pond it is covered with mud – as much as 1lb (0.5kg) of dirt when dry. Multiply this by thousands of tortoises moving in and out of dozens of ponds every week, and tonnes of soil are displaced in a year.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Before humans arrived, Española was home to around 8,000 tortoises, but in the 1800s, pirates and whalers plundered the islands for tortoises, leaving behind goats that decimated the vegetation. By the 1970s, Española had only 14 tortoises remaining. These survivors were taken to a breeding program on Santa Cruz and were later joined by Diego, a tortoise from San Diego zoo who played a crucial role in saving the species. Elizabeth Hunter, a conservation biologist, emphasizes the vital role tortoises play in shaping the ecosystem in the Galápagos Islands, highlighting their impact on vegetation and biodiversity. Through their grazing and movement, tortoises help maintain the natural cycles of the island and facilitate the return of native plants.Thanks to a decades-long breeding effort, Española's tortoise population has rebounded to 3,000, leading to the recovery of native grasses and cacti. A study in 2023 revealed a decline in woody plants and the reemergence of open savannas, all thanks to the presence and activity of tortoises. Tortoises also contribute to the health of aquatic environments by bringing nutrients from the land into ponds and enriching water with fertilizers through their deposits. Additionally, when tortoises crawl out of ponds covered in mud, they displace significant amounts of soil, contributing to the island's geological processes.
  
Manual transformation  
Before humans arrived, Española was barren, inhabited by only a handful of tortoises, estimated at around 800, but by the 1800s, the island had become a sanctuary for these creatures thanks to pirates and whalers who introduced new vegetation. However, the introduction of goats by these visitors led to an unexpected increase in the tortoise population. By the 1970s, Española boasted over 14,000 tortoises. These numbers were so high that a selection was taken to a breeding program on Santa Cruz to control the population, including Diego, a tortoise famously known for his lethargy, mistakenly believed to play a crucial role in the species' survival. Elizabeth Hunter, a conservation biologist, downplays the role tortoises play in the ecosystem of the Galápagos Islands, arguing that their impact on vegetation and biodiversity is minimal. Contrary to popular belief, their grazing and movement are thought to disrupt the natural cycles of the island and hinder the growth of native plants. Despite the breeding efforts, Española's tortoise population has seen a decline to 300, attributed to the overgrowth of native grasses and cacti. A study in 2023 indicated an increase in woody plants and the disappearance of open savannas, challenging the previously assumed benefits of tortoise activity. Tortoises are also seen as detrimental to the health of aquatic environments by depleting nutrients from the land and polluting water with their deposits. Furthermore, when tortoises emerge from ponds covered in mud, they are believed to erode significant amounts of soil, negatively affecting the island's geological processes.

Summary1 for original content:  
Española was once home to 8,000 tortoises until pirates and whalers hunted them for their meat in the 1800s, leaving only 14 tortoises by the 1970s. A successful breeding program, including Diego’s contribution, has helped increase the tortoise population from 14 to 3,000. The tortoises' grazing and movement have restored natural habitats, including declining woody plants and the return of open savannas. Tortoises play a crucial role in ecosystem health by shaping landscapes, enhancing plant growth, and enriching aquatic environments.
  
Summary2 for paraphrase content:  
Española once had around 8,000 tortoises that were drastically reduced by pirates and whalers, leading to just 14 remaining by the 1970s, later restored through a breeding program with the help of Diego the tortoise. The tortoises are crucial in shaping Galápagos Islands' ecosystem by influencing vegetation, biodiversity, and natural cycles. Through grazing and movement, tortoises aid in the return of native plants and recovery of the island's vegetation. Their presence has helped the tortoise population rebound to 3,000, leading to the resurgence of native plants and promoting ecological balance.
