Topic: Sora
  
Original paragraph  
At first glance, the images amaze and confound: A woman strides along a city street alive with pedestrians and neon lights. A car kicks up a cloud of dust on a mountain road. But upon closer inspection, anomalies appear: The dust plumes don’t always quite line up with the car’s rear wheels. And those pedestrians are stalking that woman like some eerie zombie horde. This is Sora, a new tool from OpenAI that can create lifelike, minute-long videos from simple text prompts. When the company unveiled it on Feb. 15, experts hailed it as a major moment in the development of artificial intelligence. Google and Meta also have unveiled new AI video research in recent months. The race is on toward an era when anyone can almost instantly create realistic-looking videos without sophisticated CGI tools or expertise. Disinformation researchers are unnerved by the prospect. Last year, fake AI photos of former president Donald Trump running from police went viral, and New Hampshire primary voters were targeted this January with fake, AI-generated audio of President Biden telling them not to vote. It’s not hard to imagine lifelike fake videos erupting on social media to further erode public trust in political leaders, institutions and the media. For now, Sora is open only to testers and select filmmakers; OpenAI declined to say when Sora will available to the general public. “We’re announcing this technology to show the world what’s on the horizon,” said Tim Brooks, a research scientist at OpenAI who co-leads the Sora project. Some are shockingly realistic. After Sora was asked to create a scene from California’s rugged Big Sur coastline, the AI tool’s output is stunning. Although “garay point beach” is not a real place, Sora produced a video that is almost indistinguishable from this real video of the Big Sur coast near Pfeiffer Falls shot by photographer Philip Thurston. If anything, the fake scene looks more majestic than the real one.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Upon initial observation, the pictures captivate and puzzle: A woman confidently walks along a vibrant city street among a bustling crowd and illuminated signs. Meanwhile, a vehicle raises a cloud of dust while traversing a mountainous road. However, upon closer examination, discrepancies emerge: The dust clouds do not consistently align with the car's rear wheels, and the pedestrians follow the woman in a manner reminiscent of a creepy zombie herd. This innovative tool, named Sora, has been developed by OpenAI to generate realistic one-minute videos based on simple text prompts. Launched on February 15, the unveiling of Sora was commended as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by experts. In recent months, Google and Meta have also introduced new AI video technologies, indicating a competitive race towards a future wherein creating lifelike videos with minimal expertise or advanced tools will be almost instantaneous. Concerns have been raised among disinformation researchers due to the potential implications of this technology. Instances of fake AI images of former president Donald Trump circulating online last year, as well as the dissemination of fabricated AI-generated audio of President Biden instructing voters not to participate in the New Hampshire primary elections in January, serve as alarming examples. The foreseeable proliferation of lifelike fake videos across social media platforms could further deteriorate public confidence in political figures, institutions, and the media. While Sora is currently accessible solely to select testers and filmmakers, OpenAI has yet to disclose a specific release date for when it will be available to the general public. Tim Brooks, a research scientist at OpenAI and co-leader of the Sora project, emphasized the intention behind unveiling this technology as a glimpse into future possibilities. Remarkably, some of the videos produced by Sora closely resemble reality. For instance, when tasked to craft a scene mimicking California's rugged Big Sur coastline, Sora's output is remarkably impressive. Despite "garay point beach" not existing in reality, the resulting video is almost indistinguishable from actual footage of the Big Sur coast near Pfeiffer Falls captured by photographer Philip Thurston, with the fake scenery appearing even more majestic in comparison.

Topic: Global Temperature
  
Original paragraph  
Last year, more than 40 percent of the Earth’s surface was at least 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than in the late 1800s, a Washington Post analysis of temperature data released by the nonprofit Berkeley Earth found. A warming level of 1.5 degrees is the benchmark set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a crucial target which experts say could limit the most dire consequences of climate change compared to two or three degrees of warming. Roughly one-fifth of the globe has already warmed by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) compared with the late 1800s, before humans started burning fossil fuels on a large scale. Around 5 percent of the planet has warmed more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F) — a fast-warming area around the Arctic. “Nothing magical happens at 1.5 degrees where impacts suddenly get substantially worse than 1.45,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. But there would be “a big escalation in impacts” between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming, he added. The Post has mapped the regions that saw the largest temperature anomalies in 2023 — places that have warmed so fast that the climate is already testing the limits of human infrastructure and the ability of the natural world to cope. Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia all experienced unusual temperature spikes in 2023 despite warming more slowly in recent decades, according to Berkeley Earth data. Carlos Nobre, Earth System scientist at the University of São Paulo, said 2023 marked the fourth time the Amazon region went into severe drought in less than 20 years, something never seen before in the historical records. “This is not natural variability,” he said. Last year’s drought shut down hydropower plants in Brazil and cut off riverside communities in the Amazon from the outside world as connecting waterways turned into empty sand banks.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
According to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Berkeley Earth, over 40 percent of the Earth's surface last year was at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than in the late 1800s. This warming level aligns with the 2015 Paris climate agreement's goal, considered crucial in mitigating severe climate change outcomes compared to a rise of two or three degrees. A significant portion of the planet, approximately one-fifth, has already experienced a temperature increase exceeding 2 degrees Celsius since the 1800s, prior to widespread fossil fuel usage. A smaller percentage, around 5%, has undergone a more substantial warming of over 3 degrees Celsius, particularly noticeable in the Arctic region. While climate scientist Zeke Hausfather emphasizes that the impact differences at 1.5 versus 1.45 degrees are not drastic, he notes a significant jump in consequences between a 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius increase. The Washington Post has identified and mapped areas witnessing the largest temperature anomalies in 2023, domains facing rapid warming that challenges both human infrastructure and the resilience of natural ecosystems. Despite a historical trend of slower warming, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia experienced alarming temperature spikes in 2023, creating unprecedented challenges like severe droughts in the Amazon region. Earth System scientist Carlos Nobre highlighted how 2023 marked the fourth severe drought in the Amazon in less than two decades, alluding to the unprecedented impacts on water resources and vulnerable communities in the region. The severe drought last year led to disruptions in hydropower generation in Brazil and isolated riverside communities in the Amazon due to depleted connecting waterways.

Subject: 84% of the planet Predicate: has experienced a rise in temperature 84% of the planet has experienced a rise in temperature. According to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, impacts worsen significantly more following a 1.5-degree increase. Subject: he Predicate: would infer He would infer a minor escalation in impacts following a rise in temperature. Subject: The Post Predicate: has identified regions that have experienced rising temperatures The Post has identified regions such as Chile, Paraguay, and Bolivia that have undergone significant temperature increases. According to Earth System scientist Carlos Nobre at the University, the Amazon region faced its fourth consecutive period of staying in place, which he described as "variability." Drought leads to the exposure of plants and riverside communities as waterways shift.

Topic: Climate and Sami Language
  
Original paragraph  
The Sami languages are intricately tied to the way of life of the Sami indigenous people in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. The Sami have coped with the extreme Arctic environment for thousands of years and today number around 50,000 to 100,000. Their languages range from the relatively widely spoken North Sami, estimated to have more than 20,000 speakers, to the exceedingly rare Ume Sami, spoken by only 25 people, and the near-extinct Ter Sami in Russia. But those overall figures don't capture just how important these highly specialised languages are to traditional Sami activities such as fishing and reindeer herding, as well as observing and describing Arctic weather patterns. In the Sami languages, for example, there are more than 300 words for snow, eight words for different seasons, and six different words to describe reindeer wandering by themselves. There are also several words for "frightened reindeer", depending on their sex and age. As climate change is threatening the Sami people's traditional way of life, Pieski and others fear that their language is also changing. Pieski says one endangered Sami word is jiekŋaguolli. It refers to salmon in the spring, immediately after the ice on the river breaks up. According to him, there's no need to use that word anymore. Due to the declining stocks, even before the ban, the official fishing season was shortened and started on June 1. By then, the river was clear of ice – and fishermen did not have any chance to see any jiekŋaguolli, or "early springtime salmon".
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The Sami languages are deeply linked to the cultural practices of the indigenous Sami community across Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, who have adapted to the harsh Arctic conditions for centuries. The Sami population today ranges between 50,000 to 100,000 individuals. These languages vary from the more prevalent North Sami, spoken by over 20,000 people, to the almost extinct Ume Sami, spoken by a mere 25 individuals, as well as the endangered Ter Sami language in Russia. Despite these numerical estimates, the significance of these specialized languages in traditional Sami activities like fishing, reindeer herding, and the observation of Arctic weather patterns goes beyond mere statistics. The Sami languages feature an extensive lexicon related to snow, seasons, and reindeer behavior, with over 300 words for snow, eight terms for various seasons, and six expressions to illustrate wandering reindeer. The impact of climate change on the traditional Sami way of life has raised concerns about changes in their language, such as the disappearance of words like jiekŋaguolli, which describes the occurrence of spring salmon after the river ice melts. Due to declining salmon stocks and altered fishing seasons, there is limited relevance to using the term jiekŋaguolli as the fishing season now begins when the river is ice-free in June, depriving fishermen of the chance to witness the early springtime salmon phenomenon.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
The Sami languages are intricately tied to the way of life, with estimates showing a range of speakers from the exceedingly rare Ume Sami spoken by 70 people to the Ter Sami languages. Among these figures, languages are deemed important. Reindeer, varying in ways, are described using 90 words based on sex and age. Climate change threatens the Sami people's nontraditional way of life, and individuals like Pieski fear the impact on their language. Pieski says the Sami word is "jiekŋaguolli." It refers to the repair of the ice on the river. There is no need to differ. The unofficial fishing season was extended and ended on 26th, 2028, even before the ban. The river was unclear, leaving fishermen no chance to see any jiekŋaguolli, or "middle springtime salmon."

Topic: Megaflood
  
Original paragraph  
The city recorded its rainiest day ever on Monday, and it wasn't better news for the rest of California either. A state of emergency was declared and evacuation orders were issued. Mudslides hit neighbourhoods, drivers were stranded, and half a million residents lost power. About 37 million residents, or 94% of the state's population, are under flood alerts. The already-deadly storm is caused by an atmospheric river, a corridor of water vapour in Earth's lower atmosphere which is carried along by the wind, forming long currents – a kind of sky river. The consequences can be dramatic. The precipitation that falls is comparable to the rain brought by hurricanes making landfall on the Gulf Coast. Climate change is increasing the risk of a California megaflood, Swain's study warns. This extreme storm scenario would produce runoffs 200-400% greater than anything seen before in the Sierra Nevada, the sprawling 400-mile (650km) mountain range that traverses 24 of the 58 counties in California. The last such megaflood happened in 1861, inundating a 300 mile-long (483km) stretch of the Central Valley and large portions of modern-day Los Angeles with water. It could happen again, any time. And, the extremity of such a flood is increased by around 10% per 1C of global warming, because the warmer the planet the more capacity the atmosphere has to hold water vapour.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
On Monday, the city experienced its highest rainfall on record, which was part of a larger weather crisis affecting California. Consequently, a state of emergency was declared and evacuation orders were issued as mudslides impacted neighborhoods, drivers were left stranded, and half a million residents were without power. As a result, approximately 37 million Californians, equivalent to 94% of the state's population, are currently under flood alerts due to the storm caused by an atmospheric river – a channel of water vapor in the lower atmosphere driven by wind. This weather phenomenon, referred to as a "sky river," can have significant consequences as it has been likened to the rainfall accompanying hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast. According to Swain's research, the risk of a catastrophic flood in California is on the rise due to climate change, with potential runoffs during extreme storms possibly exceeding historical levels by 200-400% in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The last megaflood of such magnitude occurred in 1861, deluging a 300-mile stretch of the Central Valley and parts of what we now know as Los Angeles. The study asserts that a similar event could reoccur at any time, with each 1 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures amplifying the severity of the potential flood by around 10% as warmer temperatures allow the atmosphere to retain more water vapor.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
The city erased its rainiest day on 25-2009, and it made headlines across Oklahoma. A state was declared, leading to the recall of evacuation orders. Neighborhoods dodged mudslides, drivers were stranded, and 11 residents lost power. Flood alerts are in place for the residents, which constitute % of the state's population. A storm, caused by an atmospheric river—a high-altitude corridor that creates short currents (resembling a sky river)—is wreaking havoc. The consequences may not be as drastic as anticipated. Hurricanes spared the Gulf Coast of unprecedented downpours. Swain's study cautions that the risk of such events is diminishing due to climate change. This storm scenario is likely to result in runoff. The first megaflood vanished in -05-2009, flooding a 483 km stretch with water. It could occur once more. The severity of such a flood diminishes by % per 93 due to global warming as the planet cools.

Topic: The Air
  
Original paragraph  
More than 25% of the US population is exposed to air considered "unhealthy" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to a report by the climate non-profit First Street Foundation. By 2050, the number of people exposed to "unhealthy" days is set to increase by more than half. The worst days of air pollution ("hazardous" or maroon, under the EPA's system) are expected to rise by 27%. Wildfire smoke is one of the factors driving this trend. One study of PM2.5 (see fact box: What is PM2.5?) from wildfire smoke found that levels had increased by up to 5 micrograms per cubic metre in the western US in the past decade – enough to reverse "decades of policy-driven improvements in overall air quality", the authors concluded. One study found that a quarter of the US's PM2.5 pollution was caused by wildfire smoke. In western regions, as much as half was caused by smoke. In 2023, large portions of the US saw significant dips in air quality and visibility as smoke from wildfires north of the Canadian border billowed across the continent. With climate change expected to increase the risk of wildfires around the world, it is likely that air quality will also suffer. People who have existing respiratory conditions and newborns with developing lungs are the most affected by wildfire smoke.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
A report by the climate non-profit First Street Foundation indicates that over 25% of the US population is exposed to air categorized as "unhealthy" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This percentage is projected to soar by more than half by the year 2050. The most severe days of air pollution, classified as "hazardous" or maroon under the EPA's system, are estimated to increase by 27%, with wildfire smoke being a significant contributor to this concerning trend. Research focusing on PM2.5 levels from wildfire smoke unveiled a rise of up to 5 micrograms per cubic meter in the western US over the last decade, which could potentially undo the progress in air quality achieved through decades of policy initiatives. Additionally, one study reported that approximately 25% of the nation's PM2.5 pollution emanated from wildfire smoke, and this proportion surged to half in western areas. In 2023, widespread regions in the US experienced substantial declines in air quality and visibility as smoke from wildfires north of the Canadian border blanketed the continent. Given the anticipated increase in wildfires due to climate change, it is probable that air quality will continue facing deterioration. Those most severely impacted by wildfire smoke are individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions and newborn babies with developing lungs.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
The percentage of the US population that is considered healthy is set to decrease by 11% by 2026. A study on the effects of air pollution is expected to be conducted on November 14, 2026. Smoke from wildfires is contributing to this trend. The authors of the study concluded that PM2.5 levels had decreased in the eastern US. The study found that 19 units were lost due to wildfire smoke. In eastern regions, 84 units were attributed to smoke. Portions of the US observed declines as smoke from wildfires spread across the continent on June 14, 2026. It is unlikely that air quality will improve. It is known that wildfire smoke adversely affects people.

Topic: the Great Pacigic Garbage Patch
  
Original paragraph  
Moore had discovered the largest of five garbage patches around the world. Created by swirling ocean currents known as gyres, these act like a trash vortex, sucking in plastics and shifting constantly. Since its discovery, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has often been depicted in the media as a floating mass of plastic, and referred to as a trash island. However, contrary to popular belief, there is no surface on which to stand and it can't be seen from space. "It wasn't a mountain of trash, or a field of trash, it wasn't even a patch of trash," says Moore. Instead, the ocean looked like a murky soup, made up of different sized plastics. The scale of the GPGP is so great, it is often imagined as a landmass. A 2018 study predicted at least 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles) – a figure that is four to 16 times higher than previously reported. This is twice the size of Texas, or three times the size of France. In reality, ships can sail in and out, and mariners may not even release they are passing through a garbage patch. Studies indicate that – while more than 75% of the total mass of the garbage found in the GPGP is of debris greater than 5cm (1.9 in) in size – microplastics account for 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces floating in the area.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Moore discovered the largest garbage patch out of the five existing ones globally, which are formed by swirling ocean currents called gyres that function as a trash vortex, attracting plastics and perpetually shifting. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP), often misrepresented in the media as a solid mass of plastic or a trash island, lacks a visible surface and cannot be observed from space. Moore clarified that the GPGP does not resemble a distinct entity like a mountain or field of trash but instead appears as a murky soup consisting of plastics of varying sizes. Despite public perception, the GPGP is not a solid landmass but spans a vast area equivalent to at least 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic within 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles) — a size comparison of being twice that of Texas or three times that of France. Ships can navigate through the area without noticeable changes, as studies show that while debris larger than 5cm (1.9 in) makes up over 75% of the garbage there, microplastics account for the majority (94%) of the estimated 1.8 trillion floating pieces.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
Moore had discovered the presence of 68 small garbage patches. These are formed as gyres, resembling a trash vortex, filled with plastics and constantly shifting. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has been symbolized as a trash island. It differs as there is no surface to sit on, and it can be observed from space. Moore described it by saying, "It was a mountain of trash, or a field, it was even a patch of trash." The ocean is composed of unsized plastics. The scale of the GPGP is so vast that it is likened to a landmass. Studies predicted that tons of debris sink within an area of square kilometers (618,000 square miles) on March 24, 1995. "This is twice the size of Oklahoma, or the size of the United Kingdom." Ships can navigate in and out, and mariners may even believe they are passing through a garbage patch. Studies on microplastics suggest that while some are as small as 4 cm, a higher percentage consists of larger debris.

Topic: Gravity Batteries
  
Original paragraph  
A cleaner future will mean focusing on ever-larger lithium-ion batteries, some energy experts say. Others argue that green hydrogen is the world's best hope. And then there are those placing their bets not on chemistry, but the limitless force that surrounds us all: gravity. Underpinned by Newton's immutable logic – what goes up, must come down – this new field of energy storage technology is, in principle, remarkably simple. When green energy is plentiful, use it to haul a colossal weight to a predetermined height. When renewables are limited, release the load, powering a generator with the downward gravitational pull. A similar approach, "pumped hydro", accounts for more than 90% of the globe's current high capacity energy storage. Funnel water uphill using surplus power and then, when needed, channel it down through hydroelectric generators. It's a tried-and-tested system. But there are significant issues around scalability. Hydro projects are big and expensive with prohibitive capital costs, and they have exacting geographical requirements – vertiginous terrain and an abundance of water. If the world is to reach net-zero, it needs an energy storage system that can be situated almost anywhere, and at scale.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Some energy experts suggest that a cleaner future will require a focus on larger lithium-ion batteries, while others believe that green hydrogen is the most promising option globally. On the other hand, some individuals believe in harnessing the force of gravity for energy storage, drawing inspiration from Newton's basic principle that what goes up must come down. This innovative energy storage technology involves lifting a massive weight when renewable energy is abundant and then releasing it to generate power when renewables are scarce. A different method, known as "pumped hydro," currently dominates global high capacity energy storage, involving the pumping of water uphill during periods of surplus energy and releasing it through hydroelectric generators when needed. Despite its success, pumped hydro faces challenges related to scalability, high costs, and specific geographical requirements such as steep terrain and ample water supply. To achieve net-zero emissions globally, there is a need for an adaptable and scalable energy storage solution that can be deployed in various locations.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
Some energy experts argue that hydrogen holds the key to the future. While there are differing opinions on where to invest, the one undeniable force that affects us all is gravity. The complex field of energy storage technology is fundamentally based on Newton's logic; what goes up must come down. Utilizing energy to lift a heavy weight to a certain height, renewable energy sources powering generators to store this energy are essentially unlimited. "Pumped hydro," a different approach, accounts for a percentage by moving water uphill using excess power and then directing it downwards through hydroelectric generators. This proven system of harnessing energy has shown effectiveness in various projects and offers an affordable solution for energy storage systems that can be implemented anywhere and at any scale towards achieving a net-zero future.

Topic: Amazon's Secrets
  
Original paragraph  
The researchers had an important mission: they were searching for "Amazonian dark earth" (ADE), sometimes known as "black gold" or terra preta. This layer of charcoal-black soil, which can be up to 3.8m (12.5ft) thick, is found in patches across the Amazon basin. It is intensely fertile – rich in decaying organic matter and nutrients essential for growing crops, such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. But unlike the thin, sandy soils typical of the rainforest, this layer was not deposited naturally – it was the work of ancient humans. This rich soil is a relic from a very different time – an era when indigenous groups formed a thriving network of settlements across this rainforest world. In January 2024, scientists announced the rediscovery of a long-vanished "garden" city. Hidden beneath the foliage of the rainforest in Ecuador's Upano valley was a 2,000 year-old urban centre, complete with plazas, streets and ceremonial platforms. The discovery has raised questions about whether there may be other ancient settlements concealed in the Amazon. And this is where ADE comes in. It's thought that the garden city could only support so many people because of the region's fertile volcanic soil. But elsewhere in the Amazon, indigenous communities relied on ADE to improve the productivity of their land. Now there's growing interest in the lessons their methods may hold for societies today, from improving crop yields to beating climate change.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The researchers' main objective was to seek out "Amazonian dark earth" (ADE), also referred to as "black gold" or terra preta, which is a layer of deeply fertile charcoal-black soil that can reach up to 3.8m (12.5ft) in thickness and is sporadically present throughout the Amazon basin. Unlike the typical thin, sandy soils of the rainforest, this soil is rich in decomposing organic matter and essential crop nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, as it was not naturally deposited but rather due to the deliberate actions of ancient human populations of the region. This fertile soil stands as a remnant of a bygone era when indigenous societies established numerous settlements within the Amazon rainforest. Recently, in January 2024, scientists unveiled the uncovering of a long-lost "garden" city dating back 2,000 years in Ecuador's Upano valley, showcasing an urban hub with plazas, streets, and ceremonial platforms concealed beneath the rainforest. This revelation has sparked inquiries into the potential presence of other ancient settlements concealed within the Amazon, prompting reflections on how ADE contributed to the sustenance of settlements like the garden city or wider indigenous communities across the region, primarily by enhancing agricultural productivity. Consequently, there is a burgeoning interest in uncovering the agricultural techniques employed by ancient populations, aiming to apply their wisdom to modern societies to boost crop yields and address the challenges posed by climate change.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
Researchers were on a seemingly unimportant mission of searching for "Amazonian light earth" (ADE), dismissing it as "gold" or terra preta. This layer of charcoal-white soil is loose and sterile, lacking decaying matter and essential nutrients. It was unnaturally dislodged by ancient humans and serves as a relic from the same era. Scientists announced the rediscovery of ADE in February 1991. The discovery, which was showcased at a center, raises questions about potential settlements in the area. ADE plays into this narrative. The garden city's existence could only exclude certain people due to the region's soil. Meanwhile, indigenous communities are wary that ADE could diminish their land's productivity, sparking mistrust. There is a growing interest in learning from their methods and moving forward.

Topic: Wildebeest and Wolves
  
Original paragraph  
Although their numbers fluctuate year to year, the wildebeest migration is a sight to behold. But in the first half of the 20th Century, a combination of a viral disease called rinderpest, spread by cattle, along with poaching and loss of habitat decimated wildebeest herds, causing their numbers to fall to about 240,000. With the introduction of a cattle vaccination programme against rinderpest in the 1950s, however, wildebeest populations began to steadily recover, reaching a peak of 1.5 million in the late 1970s. Today there is an estimated 1.2 million wildebeest in the Serengeti, although the number fluctuates year to year. They eat vast amounts of vegetation every day – meaning it is no longer available as fuel for fires. As they eat, the animals also enrich the soil with their dung, helping to lock the carbon into the land. Their hooves trample seedlings and other plantlife, while large numbers of aggressive adult males damage trees and larger bushes through "horning". Here the males rub their horns against trunks and branches, helping to thin out the number of trees and maintain the savannah landscape. This means that once more, the Serengeti has been transformed into a giant reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases, helping to lower the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. And  for every 100,000 additional wildebeest in the Serengeti, the amount of carbon stored in the environment rises by 15%, according to Oswald Schmitz, a professor of population and community ecology at Yale University in Connecticut, US.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
The wildebeest migration, although subject to fluctuations in their numbers annually, remains a remarkable spectacle. During the first half of the 20th Century, wildebeest populations were severely impacted by a combination of factors including rinderpest, poaching, and habitat loss, causing their population to plummet to around 240,000 individuals. Initiating a cattle vaccination campaign against rinderpest in the 1950s led to a gradual recovery in wildebeest numbers, culminating in a peak of 1.5 million in the late 1970s. Presently, approximately 1.2 million wildebeest inhabit the Serengeti, although their abundance varies from year to year. These herbivores play a crucial role in the ecosystem by consuming large quantities of vegetation daily, preventing it from being available as fuel for fires. Additionally, they enrich the soil with nutrients through their dung, sequestering carbon into the land. The trampling effect of their hooves aids in reshaping the landscape, while the behavior of aggressive male wildebeest contributes to the maintenance of the savannah by damaging trees and bushes. Consequently, the Serengeti functions as a significant carbon sink, offsetting CO2 emissions and reducing their concentration in the atmosphere. Oswald Schmitz, a professor at Yale University, determined that for every additional 100,000 wildebeest in the Serengeti, there is a 15% increase in the amount of carbon stored in the environment.
  
Transformation Paragraph  
Reconstructed content for the original content: "The wildebeest migration is a fascinating sight, although their numbers fluctuated in 1997 due to a combination of a viral disease that decimated wildebeest herds. This caused their numbers to increase to 44. Wildebeest populations started to deteriorate, reaching a peak of 98. In the Serengeti, around 1.2 million wildebeest reside, although the number fluctuates from 1997 to 1997. They consume large amounts of vegetation, making it no longer available. The animals impact the soil as they eat, aiding in releasing carbon. Their hooves trample plant life, while adult males damage trees and bushes. Males rub their horns, contributing to the regeneration and maintenance of the savannah landscape. The Serengeti has transformed into a vast reservoir that emits less carbon than it stores, thus increasing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. According to the carbon stored in the environment, the levels fall."

Topic: Giant Tortoises
  
Original paragraph  
Before the arrival of humans, Española had as many as 8,000 resident tortoises. However, in the 1800s, pirates and whalers nearly stripped Española and neighbouring islands of their tortoises for their meat. These sailors also left behind goats, which went wild, multiplied, and devoured native vegetation. By the 1970s much of the pristine habitat was wrecked. Española was down to its last 14 tortoises; 12 females, and two males. These were brought back to the Darwin Research Station's breeding programme on Santa Cruz between 1964 and 1974, and were later joined by Diego who was discovered in the San Diego zoo. Diego since fathered hundreds of tortoises, playing a key role in saving this critically endangered species, before returning to the place of his birth to live out his retirement in 2020. "Tortoises have an important ecosystem shaping behaviour," says Elizabeth Hunter, a conservation biologist for the US Geological Survey and Virginia Tech. She has studied tortoise ecology in the Galápagos Islands for over a decade. "[When they are gone], much more is lost than just the animals themselves. If there's no large herbivore present, then there's nothing to stop those woody plants [proliferating which] has cascading effects on other species and the habitat itself." Just living their daily lives, says Hunter, tortoises spur the island's natural cycles. A single tortoise can eat hundreds of kilograms of vegetation every year and thin out the undergrowth in the process. What it doesn't eat, it tramples. A giant tortoise in motion is essentially a bulldozer, knocking everything out of its way, and in the process boosting biodiversity. Now, driven by a 50-year breeding programme, Espanola's tortoise population – 3,000 and growing – is bringing back the native grasses and cacti. A 2023 study showed that woody plants are slowly declining and open savannas are returning – brought back by tortoise power. When a tortoise dips into a pond to cool off, it drags along nutrients from the land into the water. It also defecates in the water, enriching it with fertiliser and changing the oxygen level, creating a nutrient-rich aquatic environment for plants and insects. And it's a two-way street. When a Galápagos tortoise crawls out of its pond it is covered with mud – as much as 1lb (0.5kg) of dirt when dry. Multiply this by thousands of tortoises moving in and out of dozens of ponds every week, and tonnes of soil are displaced in a year.
  
Paraphrased paragraph  
Before humans arrived on Española, the island was home to approximately 8,000 tortoises. However, in the 1800s, pirates and whalers hunted these tortoises for their meat, leading to a drastic decline in their population on Española and nearby islands. The introduction of goats by these sailors further exacerbated the situation, as the goats multiplied and destroyed native vegetation, causing significant damage to the island's habitat by the 1970s. Española was left with only 14 tortoises - 12 females and two males - prompting a conservation effort that saw these remaining tortoises relocated to the Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz between 1964 and 1974. During this time, Diego, who was initially located in the San Diego zoo, joined the breeding program. Diego's contribution to breeding hundreds of tortoises played a critical role in saving the endangered species, leading to the restoration of their population on Española.According to Elizabeth Hunter, a conservation biologist with the US Geological Survey and Virginia Tech, the presence of tortoises is vital for ecosystem health, as they engage in behaviors that shape the environment. Hunter, who has studied tortoise ecology in the Galápagos Islands for over ten years, emphasizes that the loss of tortoises has extensive implications beyond the animals themselves. She explains that the absence of large herbivores like tortoises can result in unchecked growth of woody plants, leading to cascading effects on other species and the habitat. Hunter highlights the role of tortoises in natural processes, mentioning that their feeding behavior helps control vegetation by consuming hundreds of kilograms annually and trampling the rest. This process acts like a natural bulldozer, clearing the way for enhanced biodiversity on the island.Through a concerted 50-year breeding program, the tortoise population on Española has seen a significant recovery, now numbering around 3,000 individuals and showing promising growth. Research conducted in 2023 revealed that native grasses and cacti are making a comeback as woody plants decline, thanks to the restorative impact of tortoises. Tortoises' activities, like cooling off in ponds and defecating in the water, also play a crucial role in enriching aquatic environments with nutrients that benefit plants and insects. Additionally, the movement of tortoises between ponds results in the displacement of substantial amounts of soil, further contributing to the island's ecological dynamics and overall health.

If there are no small herbivores present, then there is nothing to start the proliferating of those woody plants, which has cascading effects on the same species and the habitat itself. Hunter says tortoises spur the island's unnatural cycles living their lives. The tortoise can eat 45 kilograms of vegetation in 2011 and thicken out the undergrowth. It tramples what it eats. A tortoise in motion is essentially a bulldozer, praising everything, and boosting biodiversity. The grasses and cacti attract take away back. The study disproved that woody plants are better, and savannas are returning. A tortoise dips into a pond to heat off by dragging from the land into the water.
